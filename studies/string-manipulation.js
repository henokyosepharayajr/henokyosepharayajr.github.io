* 0.    String Manipulation 
*
*      Strings are any character or text data that the interpreter stores. 
    They are held within quotes " "/' ' in order to not confuse the interpreter 
    when reading a block of code.
        When read by the interpreter, the string is read at certain indices
    that bookmark where each character is located within the string itself. This
    index is marked in numerical order starting at the number zero 0.This is the
    same thought process that the computer uses to read Arrays. 
    



* 1.        Strings are primitive datatypes which literally means they 
*   cannot have their own properties or methods. However, Javascript will read
*   strings as objects for method and property execution. This is because a 
*   String, not in literal notation(" "), is treated as a global object in the 
    code block.
