/* 
* Data Types : 
* 
* 0.    How many data types are there? ALOT! They can be grouped into two tiers of
* classifications, either simple(primitive) or complex. Within these two data type 
* classifications exist many other data types.
*
* 1.   Simple includes:
*            numbers(var total = 1024), 
*            string(var firstName = 'Julius'),
*            boolean(true/false), 
*            NaN, undefined, and Null.
* 
* These datatypes are simple because they do not hold or aggregate other values. 
* Nor do they alter the orgiinal value when it is returned. 
* Their value is the only way to copy one variable to another.
*
* 2. Complex datatypes include the following
*   -Object
*   -Array
*   -Function
* These values can be aggregated into each other making them infinitely proportioned. 
* They can only be copied or passed by their respective reference. the reference
* is made to a memory address not the data value.
