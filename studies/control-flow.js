* 0. Control flow -
*        The control flow is the direction or order which the computer fulfills
*    or executes statements in a body of code. You could treat this as reading
*    an article in a newspaper. Granted the text is written in the respective order, 
*    You would typically read from left to right and top to bottom. In Japan books 
*    and other publications are written in a right to left direction. Don't worry 
*    you wont need to take this into account. haha! 
*
* 1. Conditional Statements - 
*   Conditional statements rely on the Boolean value of a code in order to follow
* through with executing.
*
*   If Statement
    example: if (condition){
        // code to run
    } 
*    
* Else if -
* this is an alternate condition that will run if our intial if statement did not
* come back as true.
* 
* Else 
* A final condition that only runs if the only condition met is false.
