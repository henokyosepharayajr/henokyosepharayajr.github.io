/* 
* Loops
* 
* 0. Essentially, a loop is a block of code written in a way that allows 
*   the interpreter to repeatedly read the given data. There are two kinds of
* loops that we use in Javascript : For Loops and While Loops. 
*
*
* 1. For Loops 
*
*   For loops have three main components in order to run. What allows them to 
* run are their index which is esentially a number. This index will either
* grow or shrinken according to its incrementer. This is often written in the
* form of i++ or i--. And finally the third leg of a for loop is its stopping 
* condition. This is the number that the loop will stop at when it reaches it.
*
*for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  return true;
}
*
* 2. While Loops
*
*   A while loop will "loop" through a given code block or data as long as 
the condition of true is initially met. It will loop through the code once
before it checks to see if the condition of true is met. After checking it 
will repeatedlt do so. It is easy to make a while run an infinite loop which
would make the computer crash. 

EXAMPLE: while(x<5){
    console.log("X is less than 5")
}
